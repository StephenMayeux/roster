# Class Roster at LEARN Academy

My name is Stephen Mayeux, and I am an instructor candidate at the LEARN Academy in San Diego! I needed help remembering your names during the demo lesson, so I wrote this React/Redux application to help me.

###Getting Started###

In the demo lesson, I went over three very common and useful Array methods in JavaScript. I actually use two of them in this application! I encourage you to `fork` and `clone` this repo to your local machine and take a deep dive in the code.

To see an example of the `map()` method, go to `./src/components/add_student.js` and look at line 11.

To see an example of the `filter()` method, go to `./src/reducers/students.js` and look at line 6.

####Familiar with Git?#####
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the webpack process with the following:

```
	> git clone git@github.com:StephenMayeux/roster.git
	> cd roster
	> npm install
	> npm start
```

Then open up your browser and point it to `localhost:8080` to use the application yourself.
